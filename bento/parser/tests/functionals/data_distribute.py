 'description': '===============================\nInstalling and Using Distribute\n===============================\n\n.. contents:: **Table of Contents**\n\n-----------\nDisclaimers\n-----------\n\nAbout the fork\n==============\n\n`Distribute` is a fork of the `Setuptools` project.\n\nDistribute is intended to replace Setuptools as the standard method\nfor working with Python module distributions.\n\nThe fork has two goals:\n\n- Providing a backward compatible version to replace Setuptools\n  and make all distributions that depend on Setuptools work as\n  before, but with less bugs and behaviorial issues.\n\n  This work is done in the 0.6.x series.\n\n  Starting with version 0.6.2, Distribute supports Python 3.\n  Installing and using distribute for Python 3 code works exactly\n  the same as for Python 2 code, but Distribute also helps you to support\n  Python 2 and Python 3 from the same source code by letting you run 2to3\n  on the code as a part of the build process, by setting the keyword parameter\n  ``use_2to3`` to True. See http://packages.python.org/distribute for more\n  information.\n\n- Refactoring the code, and releasing it in several distributions.\n  This work is being done in the 0.7.x series but not yet released.\n\nThe roadmap is still evolving, and the page that is up-to-date is\nlocated at : `http://packages.python.org/distribute/roadmap`.\n\nIf you install `Distribute` and want to switch back for any reason to\n`Setuptools`, get to the `Uninstallation instructions`_ section.\n\nMore documentation\n==================\n\nYou can get more information in the Sphinx-based documentation, located\nat http://packages.python.org/distribute. This documentation includes the old\nSetuptools documentation that is slowly replaced, and brand new content.\n\nAbout the installation process\n==============================\n\nThe `Distribute` installer modifies your installation by de-activating an\nexisting installation of `Setuptools` in a bootstrap process. This process\nhas been tested in various installation schemes and contexts but in case of a\nbug during this process your Python installation might be left in a broken\nstate. Since all modified files and directories are copied before the\ninstallation starts, you will be able to get back to a normal state by reading\nthe instructions in the `Uninstallation instructions`_ section.\n\nIn any case, it is recommended to save you `site-packages` directory before\nyou start the installation of `Distribute`.\n\n-------------------------\nInstallation Instructions\n-------------------------\n\nDistribute is only released as a source distribution.\n\nIt can be installed using pip, and can be done so with the source tarball,\nor by using the ``distribute_setup.py`` script provided online.\n\n``distribute_setup.py`` is the simplest and preferred way on all systems.\n\ndistribute_setup.py\n===================\n\nDownload\n`distribute_setup.py <http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py>`_\nand execute it, using the Python interpreter of your choice.\n\nIf your shell has the ``curl`` program you can do::\n\n    $ curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py\n    $ python distribute_setup.py\n\nNotice this file is also provided in the source release.\n\npip\n===\n\nRun easy_install or pip::\n\n    $ pip install distribute\n\nSource installation\n===================\n\nDownload the source tarball, uncompress it, then run the install command::\n\n    $ curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.27.tar.gz\n    $ tar -xzvf distribute-0.6.27.tar.gz\n    $ cd distribute-0.6.27\n    $ python setup.py install\n\n---------------------------\nUninstallation Instructions\n---------------------------\n\nLike other distutils-based distributions, Distribute doesn\'t provide an\nuninstaller yet. It\'s all done manually! We are all waiting for PEP 376\nsupport in Python.\n\nDistribute is installed in three steps:\n\n1. it gets out of the way an existing installation of Setuptools\n2. it installs a `fake` setuptools installation\n3. it installs distribute\n\nDistribute can be removed like this:\n\n- remove the ``distribute*.egg`` file located in your site-packages directory\n- remove the ``setuptools.pth`` file located in you site-packages directory\n- remove the easy_install script located in you ``sys.prefix/bin`` directory\n- remove the ``setuptools*.egg`` directory located in your site-packages directory,\n  if any.\n\nIf you want to get back to setuptools:\n\n- reinstall setuptools using its instruction.\n\nLastly:\n\n- remove the *.OLD.* directory located in your site-packages directory if any,\n  **once you have checked everything was working correctly again**.\n\n-------------------------\nQuick help for developers\n-------------------------\n\nTo create an egg which is compatible with Distribute, use the same\npractice as with Setuptools, e.g.::\n\n    from setuptools import setup\n\n    setup(...\n    )\n\nTo use `pkg_resources` to access data files in the egg, you should\nrequire the Setuptools distribution explicitly::\n\n    from setuptools import setup\n\n    setup(...\n        install_requires=[\'setuptools\']\n    )\n\nOnly if you need Distribute-specific functionality should you depend\non it explicitly. In this case, replace the Setuptools dependency::\n\n    from setuptools import setup\n\n    setup(...\n        install_requires=[\'distribute\']\n    )\n\n-----------\nInstall FAQ\n-----------\n\n- **Why is Distribute wrapping my Setuptools installation?**\n\n   Since Distribute is a fork, and since it provides the same package\n   and modules, it renames the existing Setuptools egg and inserts a\n   new one which merely wraps the Distribute code. This way, full\n   backwards compatibility is kept for packages which rely on the\n   Setuptools modules.\n\n   At the same time, packages can meet their dependency on Setuptools\n   without actually installing it (which would disable Distribute).\n\n- **How does Distribute interact with virtualenv?**\n\n  Everytime you create a virtualenv it will install setuptools by default.\n  You either need to re-install Distribute in it right after or pass the\n  ``--distribute`` option when creating it.\n\n  Once installed, your virtualenv will use Distribute transparently.\n\n  Although, if you have Setuptools installed in your system-wide Python,\n  and if the virtualenv you are in was generated without the `--no-site-packages`\n  option, the Distribute installation will stop.\n\n  You need in this case to build a virtualenv with the `--no-site-packages`\n  option or to install `Distribute` globally.\n\n- **How does Distribute interacts with zc.buildout?**\n\n  You can use Distribute in your zc.buildout, with the --distribute option,\n  starting at zc.buildout 1.4.2::\n\n  $ python bootstrap.py --distribute\n\n  For previous zc.buildout versions, *the only thing* you need to do\n  is use the bootstrap at `http://python-distribute.org/bootstrap.py`.  Run\n  that bootstrap and ``bin/buildout`` (and all other buildout-generated\n  scripts) will transparently use distribute instead of setuptools.  You do\n  not need a specific buildout release.\n\n  A shared eggs directory is no problem (since 0.6.6): the setuptools egg is\n  left in place unmodified.  So other buildouts that do not yet use the new\n  bootstrap continue to work just fine.  And there is no need to list\n  ``distribute`` somewhere in your eggs: using the bootstrap is enough.\n\n  The source code for the bootstrap script is located at\n  `http://bitbucket.org/tarek/buildout-distribute`.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------\nFeedback and getting involved\n-----------------------------\n\n- Mailing list: http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/distutils-sig\n- Issue tracker: http://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issues/\n- Code Repository: http://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute\n\n=======\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n------\n0.6.27\n------\n\n* Support current snapshots of CPython 3.3.\n* Distribute now recognizes README.rst as a standard, default readme file.\n* Exclude \'encodings\' modules when removing modules from sys.modules.\n  Workaround for \\#285.\n* Issue \\#231: Don\'t fiddle with system python when used with buildout\n  (bootstrap.py)\n\n------\n0.6.26\n------\n\n* Issue \\#183: Symlinked files are now extracted from source distributions.\n* Issue \\#227: Easy_install fetch parameters are now passed during the\n  installation of a source distribution; now fulfillment of setup_requires\n  dependencies will honor the parameters passed to easy_install.\n\n------\n0.6.25\n------\n\n* Issue \\#258: Workaround a cache issue\n* Issue \\#260: distribute_setup.py now accepts the --user parameter for\n  Python 2.6 and later.\n* Issue \\#262: package_index.open_with_auth no longer throws LookupError\n  on Python 3.\n* Issue \\#269: AttributeError when an exception occurs reading Manifest.in\n  on late releases of Python.\n* Issue \\#272: Prevent TypeError when namespace package names are unicode\n  and single-install-externally-managed is used.
