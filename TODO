"Killer" features:
	- simplicity above all
	- // build
	- easy customization of build
	- basic dependency handling

Before inclusion in toydist:
	- being able to build simple extensions on unix/macosx/windows
	- basic customization (through env variables)
	- easy customization for new extension (e.g. .pyx)
	- basic configuration stage ? (at least to check env sanity + setting
	  env flags)

This means:
	- Understand waf execution model - in particular how to deal with
	  signatures for generated nodes (e.g. find dependencies of generated
	  files)
	- Finish task basic design
	- Add basic task manager
	- Implement simple sys configuration for linux, mac os x and windows
