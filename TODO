TODO:

    - add msi support
    - add proper egg support
    - add mpkg support
    - port stdeb to toydist
    - rename toydist to bento
    - specify hook mechanism
    - integrate yaku or fbuild
    - add runtime support to install paths
    - test command support
    - distcheck support
    - think about integration with sphinx for doc

Not well thought out yet:
    - pkg_resources: the thing is a giant unmaintainable mess, but can
      we afford ignoring it ?
