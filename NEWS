===================
0.0.3 Release Notes
===================

This revision is a major improvement on 0.0.2, and adds numerous
features such as parallel build, hook mechanism and one file packaging
to easily use bento without adding dependencies.

Bento is still considered experimental, and any of its API subjected to change.
The static format syntax is considered relatively stable, though.

Highlights
==========

Toydist renamed to bento
------------------------

Bento means lunchbox in Japanese. Bento are often well packaged, and
this software aims at doing the same for your python package.

Hook mechanism
--------------

It is now possible to override some bento commands with a hook file
which is just a python script. Although not well documented yet, it
should enable complex customization, like interfacing with a build
system (waf, scons, make), dynamically modify the package content,
etc... the examples/hooks directory contains a few simple examples.

Yaku, build mini-framework
--------------------------

In version 0.0.2, bento still depended on distutils internally to
build extensions. Bento now uses yaku, a mini build framework. Yaku
main features are:

    - File content-based tracking: if a file content is changed, it is
      automatically rebuild
    - Environment changes detection: if the compilation options
      change, the files are automatically rebuilt
    - Multiple jobs execution (experimental)
    - Easily customizable

It should noted that bento was conceived to remain agnostic to the
build system, and will remain so. In particular, projects with complex
build issues are advised to use make, scons or waf. Future versions of
bento will contain helpers for some of those tools.

One file distribution
---------------------

Bento now includes a one file distribution of itself, so that you only
need to include that one file in your project to use bento. The file
weights ~350 kb, and can be reduced to ~80 kb if you don't need to
include windows binary installer support.

Improved command line interface
-------------------------------
