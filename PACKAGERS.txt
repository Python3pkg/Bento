Bento is considered in planning phase, and as such, the authors discourage
packaging it for linux and other OS for the time being.

Nevertheless, this document contains a few packaging details to help for the
packaging. Those details are unlikely to change once bento stabilitized.

To ease its distribution, bento bundles all its dependencies besides the python
standard library:

	- Ply (version 3.3)
	- Simplejson
	- Yaku (git version)

Of those three, only yaku will be updated frequently. Although bundled, those
correspond to upstream versions, and no modification is allowed. This is so
that using unbundled version is possible. It is not fully implemented yet, but
bento will have a configuration option to install it without any bundled
package.
