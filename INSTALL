You can install bento as follows:

	- using bento itself (recommended)::

		python bootstrap.py
		./bentomaker install

	you can fine-tune installation directories using configure before
	install::

		# use bentomaker help configure for a list of options
		./bentomaker configure --prefix=/opt
		./bentomaker install

	- using setup.py::

		python setup.py install
	
	Using setup.py is not recommended: it is mostly here so that pip knows
	how to install bento, as it expects a setup.py
