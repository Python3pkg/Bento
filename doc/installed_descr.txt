Introduction
============

A manifest to describe an installed package would be nice. It would be used as
the main input for an install (and uninstall) command::

	.# It should be easy (and fast) to parse
	.# It would list all the files installed on the system + the basic
	   metadata (at least the ones from PKG-INFO).
	.# It should be as human-readable as possible (but not at the cost of
	   speed)
	.# It should be rich enough to create any binary installer: eggs, msi,
	   wininst, pkg, etc...

Problems::

        .# How to encode filenames: fully resolved or relative to a base dir ?
        .# Which category: eggs only make a difference between .py and .so, but
           we need more than that
        .# Think about the case where each category is installed in different
           prefix.

Use cases::

	.# Actually install a package from the description (user vs global)
	.# Convert the description to an egg
	.# Convert the description to a bdist_wininst

Format
======

It is an aggregation of three parts::

        Metadata
        Variables
        Filelists
