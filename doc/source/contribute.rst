How to contribute
=================

Although toydist is still in early stages, there are several ways to contribute
to the project effectively if you are interested:

    - Try the convert command on as many packages as possible, and report failures
    - Report toydist bugs

You may also look at the TODO list, and take a shot at the missing features. As
toydist design is still in flux, please discuss any non-trivial feature on the
Mailing List.
